# ðŸ§© Project Architecture: A Component-Based Approach

This application is built using a modern, component-based architecture with **React**. Each component has a specific and well-defined responsibility, making the codebase modular, easier to maintain, and scalable. The components work together to create a seamless user experience, from browsing users to sending and managing skill swap requests.

Below is a detailed explanation of each component's role and its interactions within the application.

---

## Core Layout & User Flow Components

These components are the backbone of the application, managing the main views and user navigation.

#### `Mainpage.jsx`
*   **Purpose:** The central hub and landing page of the application.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   Displays a paginated list of all users by rendering multiple `UserCard` components.
    *   Manages the global authentication state (`isLoggedIn`, `showLogin`).
    *   Handles the display of the `login.jsx` component as a modal.
    *   Acts as the entry point to the "request a swap" user flow. When a user clicks "Request" on a `UserCard`, this component renders the `App` (`buttom.jsx`) component to handle the subsequent screens.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Renders a list of `UserCard` components.
    *   Renders `LoginPage` within a modal.
    *   Renders `App` (`buttom.jsx`) to transition to the user profile view.

#### `buttom.jsx` (App.jsx)
*   **Purpose:** Acts as a **Screen Manager** or a mini-router for the skill swap flow.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   Manages the state of the current view (`profile` or `request`).
    *   Receives user data from `Mainpage.jsx` and passes it down to the appropriate child component.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Rendered by `Mainpage.jsx`.
    *   Conditionally renders either `SkillSwapPlatform` (`userprofile.jsx`) to show a user's profile or `SkillRequestForm` (`skill.jsx`) to create a request.
    *   Handles the "back" navigation from the request form to the profile view.

## User Interaction & Forms

These components are focused on capturing user input and handling form-based actions.

#### `login.jsx`
*   **Purpose:** Provides a secure and user-friendly authentication form.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   A self-contained form to collect user credentials (email and password).
    *   Manages its own state, including form data, loading status, and input focus effects.
    *   Communicates success or closure back to the parent component (`Mainpage.jsx`) via callback props (`onClose`, `onLoginSuccess`).
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Displayed inside a modal on `Mainpage.jsx`.

#### `profile.jsx`
*   **Purpose:** The **Editable User Profile** page for the logged-in user.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   Allows the logged-in user to view and edit their own personal information (name, location, etc.).
    *   Provides an interface to add or remove skills from their "Skills Offered" and "Skills Wanted" lists.
    *   Handles "Save" and "Discard" actions for profile changes.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   This component is a destination screen, likely navigated to from a main header link (e.g., "My Profile").

#### `skill.jsx`
*   **Purpose:** The dedicated form for creating and submitting a **Skill Swap Request**.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   Allows the user to select one of their skills to offer.
    *   Allows the user to select one of the target user's wanted skills.
    *   Includes a textarea for a personalized message.
    *   Handles form submission and provides a "Back to Profile" navigation option.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Rendered by the `buttom.jsx` screen manager.
    *   Receives the target user's data as props to populate the "wanted skills" dropdown.

## Data Display & Presentation Components

These components are primarily responsible for displaying data to the user in a structured and visually appealing way.

#### `UserCards.jsx`
*   **Purpose:** A reusable component to display a summary of a user in a list.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   Clearly displays the user's name, skills offered, skills wanted, and rating.
    *   Features a dynamic "Request" button that changes its text and behavior based on the `isLoggedIn` prop passed from `Mainpage.jsx`.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Rendered in a loop by `Mainpage.jsx`.
    *   Its `onRequestClick` function triggers an action in the `Mainpage.jsx` parent component.

#### `userprofile.jsx` (SkillSwapPlatform)
*   **Purpose:** A **Public, View-Only Profile** of another user. This is what users see before deciding to send a request.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   Displays detailed information about a user, including their full lists of skills offered and wanted, and their rating/feedback.
    *   Contains the "Request" button that initiates the final step of the swap flow.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   Rendered by `buttom.jsx`.
    *   When its "Request" button is clicked, it signals `buttom.jsx` to switch the view to `skill.jsx`.

#### `swapplatform.jsx`
*   **Purpose:** A **Swap Request Dashboard** for the logged-in user.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   Fetches and displays all incoming skill swap requests.
    *   Shows the status of each request (pending, accepted, rejected).
    *   Provides "Accept" and "Reject" buttons for the user to act on pending requests.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   A destination screen, likely linked from a "Swap Requests" button in the main header.

## Placeholder / Future Components

These files are part of the planned architecture but are not yet fully implemented or are placeholders.

*   `Header.jsx`: Intended to be a global navigation header for the application.
*   `Pagination.jsx`: Intended to encapsulate the pagination logic and UI.
*   `SearchBar.jsx`: Intended to hold the functionality for searching and filtering users.
